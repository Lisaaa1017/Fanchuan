She didn‚Äôt help stage a coup to prevent the peaceful transfer of power and upend democracy as we know it. 

>> Kamala rec‚Äôd‚Äô zero (0) votes in the 2021 primary

There was no primary in 2021 that Kamala was a part of. She was vice president in 2021. 

>> two assassination attempts on Trump

That have been condemned by democrats

>> hi-ranking FBI agents worked to defeat Trump

First of all, high*-ranking. 

Second, this didn‚Äôt happen. What you might be thinking of is James Comey announcing reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails less than two weeks before the 2016 election, which undeniably had an impact of some degree on voters. She lost fair and square (as did Trump in 2020), but that absolutely had an effect.

Comey‚Äôs actions were done to clear Hillary before her expected 2016 win. Done so they could say she god been investigated & cleared by FBI. Thank God she lost‚Ä¶.and in a spectacular fashion.
