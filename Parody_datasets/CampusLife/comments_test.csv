India overtook China in population 2 years ago and not even peaking soon. So much more time for you to win in something. 10 years later? 20 years later? Maybe never? I think your culture is just weak... You already lost in food. No need to talk about east asian cuisine / south asian cuisine in the west... Chinese food is king there and the varieties and styles makes even Japanese cuisine (the runner up) look small and limited in comparison despite all the extra marketing and better image of japan than china. South asian? Curry. Done,2,0

 just a few points:
 
 1. there is no way he will get 100k if he goes to trial. 100k lies within the range of defaming public figures like LKY and LHL. he is nowhere near a public figure, and im sure your lawyers have advised you accordingly.
 
 
 2. his entire strat is very transparent - commence proceedings, make you incur expensive legal fees until you are desperate, and you have to settle on his terms. i leave that to your lawyers to advise, but at this stage you don't really have leverage to get a good deal. unless -
 
 
 3. you plead defence of truth / justification / fair comment, and take out discovery application against him and ask for all the relevant documents to prove that whatever you are saying is true or fair comment. see the Rachel Wong defamation case against Olivia Wu, whereby Olivia got a discovery order for Rachel to disclose all her (among others) text messages to prove her infidelity. these documents will be part of the public record. put the allegations against him solely in issue before the court. but again, you should get your lawyers to advise you accordingly. 
 
 
 legal fees can get very expensive and i hope you got a good and kind lawyer willing to do some low bono for you. all the best!

 1. The poster is NOT saying u should not apply to the uni or u should protest. It is simply saying you should be aware of this. Why are people so incredibly affected by this? NTU's support for Israel is well documented, as stated here. And Israel, is definitely killing civilians, aligning with definiton of genocide, so NTU is complicit. The poster is not blaming u for this, it is empowering you to know this. Knowledge is power, critical thinking is in short supply. Pls set aside your ego, and consider this objectively. 
 
 2. Why are ppl here making this a religious issue? Ask yourself this - yes, religion might tether some ppl here to the tragedy, but do u really think ppl are voicing out their opinons cuz of their religion? Or are they seeing ppl murdered and advocating for a stop? If you are informed by a patriotic sense of duty to nation, making you analyse this with a relgious lens -- arent you informed by a religious fervour to your nation more than ppl are infleunced by religion to stop civilains dying?
 
 3. Lastly, how did this comment make you feel? Are you offended? Why? Is it because I am challening your beliefs or as someone here put it, being ""fanatical to the Palestinian side"". Why is being against killing civilians fanatism? And before anyone brings this talking point up - I am against the killing of civilains in all sides. I condemn Hamas, and I condemn Bibi and Bengevir's Israel. I do not codemn Palestinians and Israelis. 
 
 I am proud to be aSingaporean BUT I recognise that my country is unbashedly supporting genocide. Sit with this line for a bit. What this means is that, you can feel a certain sense of belonging to your community, and at the same time be able criticise it. If you disagree with -- wont you call this religious fanatism? 
 
 I am keen to hear your perspectives.","Where do you draw the line in complicity? If the existence of company A benefits Company B somehow which benefits the state of Israel, is A to blame or B? Or both? Should A ditch the dealings? How many levels of loops is acceptable? 
 
 We have enough examples given in this thread on how many components of our lives are 'complicit' so what do we do? 
 
 2. I think why some of us prescribe this as a religious issue is because some lofty individuals have very often determined our moral compass by how loud we seem to be on social platforms. From what I can see, most of the Muslims are comparatively driven about this issue due to the Muslim population in Gaza. Yes there are other religious populations but the majority of them are Muslim. 
 
 Am I wrong if I am not as vocal about it as you are on the issue? We are people of different backgrounds and different life experiences. Say I am a Chinese Taoist taxi driver who has been poor my whole life, my platform would be devoted to protesting about the 9% gst. Am I wrong if I don't connect to the Gazans as much as you? Isn't it the same for the Muslims who have absolutely no regard for the ongoing civil war and daily death tolls in Myanmar? Can I blame the Muslims if they don't connect to the people living there and aren't as vocal as I am? Yes it is a humanitarian issue in Gaza but am I criticised if I am seemingly less committed to the cause since I connect to other issues more?

 To clarify, I messed up the terminology the first time and mistakenly said I was being sued, when it was merely a Letter of Demand. Which is like a warning letter. After my lawyer responded, they said they would sue. And now they have mounted the /actual/ lawsuit. I apologize for not being able to respond to the comments from last time, because I was being PM'ed immense amounts of shit. Likewise, this time I'll be avoiding social media and just posting any updates on my IG. My Reddit DMs are closed. You can call me whatever you like, make rape and death threats, I heard it all the first time and I won't be even reading them this time.
 
 I just want to mention here that I will not be setting up a GFM, I don't believe in taking money from people especially because many people reading this who've expressed willingness to donate are university students just like me, and that's just not the right thing to do imo. I don't want to take anybody's money. IF YOU SEE A GFM, IT IS NOT ME. 
 
 At this stage, ""just apologize"" to Ethan is not going to work, because the lawsuit has commenced, and he may ask for damages, similar to the original Letter of Demand asking for $100k and for me to pay for a $7k advertising spot to post a public apology. That's really all I can say right now. At this point, no matter what happens, I have lost already, because I'll have to fork out money to defend against this. And it is my parents' money, which ramps up the guilt. 
 
 Thanks for reading if you got this far. This is all I have to say.

 The drinking session was held on Oct 15, 2022 in Ethan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Hall of Residence room after a union committee meeting, according to Xinruo. She said a total of six union members attended, including her, Ethan, then-NTUSU president, then-NTUSU chief of staff and two other union Exco members. 
 
 It also noted that a complaint, which was filed in September, did not report any form of sexual misconduct and the investigation also did not find any sexual misconduct as alleged in some social media posts. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe university is concerned by some comments posted online and urges online users to refrain from making speculative and unsubstantiated allegations,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said NTU.

 just a few points:
 
 1. there is no way he will get 100k if he goes to trial. 100k lies within the range of defaming public figures like LKY and LHL. he is nowhere near a public figure, and im sure your lawyers have advised you accordingly.
 
 
 2. his entire strat is very transparent - commence proceedings, make you incur expensive legal fees until you are desperate, and you have to settle on his terms. i leave that to your lawyers to advise, but at this stage you don't really have leverage to get a good deal. unless -
 
 
 3. you plead defence of truth / justification / fair comment, and take out discovery application against him and ask for all the relevant documents to prove that whatever you are saying is true or fair comment. see the Rachel Wong defamation case against Olivia Wu, whereby Olivia got a discovery order for Rachel to disclose all her (among others) text messages to prove her infidelity. these documents will be part of the public record. put the allegations against him solely in issue before the court. but again, you should get your lawyers to advise you accordingly. 
 
 
 legal fees can get very expensive and i hope you got a good and kind lawyer willing to do some low bono for you. all the best!

 of course, there is always the risk that she will lose in court and thus having to pay money to ethan + costs + her own legal fees. but like i said, it can fairly be said that there is a fair chance that ethan will not get 100k. the figure is quite ridiculous. in the soh rui yong case, ashley liew was given 120k for *five* defamatory statements made by SRY (ie around 24k per statement). this one only got one, and ashley liew - being a former sportsman - is arguably more prominent than a mere NTU student. 
 
 in fact, LHL got 100k (general damages) from leong sze hian. leong shared an article which stated that LHL was involved in the 1MDB scandal. is the statement made by nadine equally or more serious and grave than alleging that an actual sitting prime minister is corrupt?

 The main issue was always that that LinkedIn post, even when prefaced by saying ""this information came from the discussions in r/NTU"" or something along those lines wasn't enough to shift the blame to Reddit's unhinged discussions but rather since it was accompanied with Nadine's opinions on future actions that might be able to be taken against Ethan based on those uncontrolled rumors (Ethan wanting to get a confession out of the victim, for example). With that, this lawsuit became scarily viable for Ethan to pursue because as difficult as it is to prove romantic feelings weren't involved in the court of law, it's also as difficult if not harder to prove that they were, especially considering Nadine's position as an NUS and not an NTU student, not even minding the possibility of being a SU student that might see or know people that have seen Ethan's behaviors.
 
 But I want to stress that Ethan's public perception, which is also shared by me, is dogwater thanks to this lawsuit. I get it, Ethan is *probably* trying to recoup reputational and potential future loss of career fees, which unfortunately I think is fair as this post was directly put up on LinkedIn for a reason I presume. But not even giving her an option to just take down the post or settle things personally without immediately giving her a lawsuit threat is insanely scummy to me and probably a lot of you. Because it looks to us as if it's not Ethan trying to get back his lost career and reputation, it looks a lot like he's trying to cause the most damage to Nadine financially because he can.
 
 What's happening to Nadine is insanely saddening and Ethan's a piece of crap, but I can only wonder that the reason this happened in the first place is due to the unsubstantiated accusations laid upon Ethan here on r/NTU under the guise of anonymity influencing Nadine's decision to put the LinkedIn post with those claims forward to begin with.
 
 &#x200B;
 
 Edit: Mods have restored Nadine's comment and it seems that the initial email was a warning letter. My point still stands, that's a scummy move, I don't think anyone would just fork over $100,000 without a fight or even apologize for something that at the time seemed like reasonable statements, which I *predict* is something Ethan's lawyers knew and sent the letter with that in mind (therefore pressuring her to fight and exhausting her finances).",How is it sad?

502,k5fc09w,k5e88qh,262,72.0,"Hi, this is Nadine - 
 
 To clarify, I messed up the terminology the first time and mistakenly said I was being sued, when it was merely a Letter of Demand. Which is like a warning letter. After my lawyer responded, they said they would sue. And now they have mounted the /actual/ lawsuit. I apologize for not being able to respond to the comments from last time, because I was being PM'ed immense amounts of shit. Likewise, this time I'll be avoiding social media and just posting any updates on my IG. My Reddit DMs are closed. You can call me whatever you like, make rape and death threats, I heard it all the first time and I won't be even reading them this time.
 
 I just want to mention here that I will not be setting up a GFM, I don't believe in taking money from people especially because many people reading this who've expressed willingness to donate are university students just like me, and that's just not the right thing to do imo. I don't want to take anybody's money. IF YOU SEE A GFM, IT IS NOT ME. 
 
 At this stage, ""just apologize"" to Ethan is not going to work, because the lawsuit has commenced, and he may ask for damages, similar to the original Letter of Demand asking for $100k and for me to pay for a $7k advertising spot to post a public apology. That's really all I can say right now. At this point, no matter what happens, I have lost already, because I'll have to fork out money to defend against this. And it is my parents' money, which ramps up the guilt. 
 
 Thanks for reading if you got this far. This is all I have to say.

 1. The poster is NOT saying u should not apply to the uni or u should protest. It is simply saying you should be aware of this. Why are people so incredibly affected by this? NTU's support for Israel is well documented, as stated here. And Israel, is definitely killing civilians, aligning with definiton of genocide, so NTU is complicit. The poster is not blaming u for this, it is empowering you to know this. Knowledge is power, critical thinking is in short supply. Pls set aside your ego, and consider this objectively. 
 
 2. Why are ppl here making this a religious issue? Ask yourself this - yes, religion might tether some ppl here to the tragedy, but do u really think ppl are voicing out their opinons cuz of their religion? Or are they seeing ppl murdered and advocating for a stop? If you are informed by a patriotic sense of duty to nation, making you analyse this with a relgious lens -- arent you informed by a religious fervour to your nation more than ppl are infleunced by religion to stop civilains dying?
 
 3. Lastly, how did this comment make you feel? Are you offended? Why? Is it because I am challening your beliefs or as someone here put it, being ""fanatical to the Palestinian side"". Why is being against killing civilians fanatism? And before anyone brings this talking point up - I am against the killing of civilains in all sides. I condemn Hamas, and I condemn Bibi and Bengevir's Israel. I do not codemn Palestinians and Israelis. 
 
 I am proud to be aSingaporean BUT I recognise that my country is unbashedly supporting genocide. Sit with this line for a bit.

 Of course, there's always the courtroom. But it's also very important how the public perceives a person. Take, for example, the double Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey. In late July this year, he was acquitted *by a jury* in England of multiple charges of sexual assault: [source](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/26/kevin-spacey-cleared-of-sexually-assaulting-four-men). However, this did not stop a London theatre from cancelling a movie premiere in which he stars only as a *voice actor* \- i.e. doesn't even appear on screen: [here](https://variety.com/2023/film/global/kevin-spacey-control-premiere-canceled-sexual-assault-trial-1235757051/). It was reported that the person who runs the location, Greg Lynn, said:
 
 >√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLast night it came to our attention that your film features Kevin Spacey, in particular his first film since the court case,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Lynn continued. √¢‚Ç¨≈ì**My staff as well as I are horrified that we are being mentioned in the same breath as his new film for the premiere.**√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
 
 Obviously, we don't know exactly *why* this person was horrified. It could be for any number of reasons. But given that the criminal trial was in the UK (and publicised all around the world) *and, more importantly*, prior to this Kevin Spacey did not face any career-threatening accusations on this scale or gravity, one has to be naive to believe that these sexual assault allegations against Spacey weren't a factor on Mr Lynn's mind.

468,k5hughd,k5enx8u,255,232.0,"What's happening to Nadine is really sad but my main thing is that this was foreseen.
 
 The main issue was always that that LinkedIn post, even when prefaced by saying ""this information came from the discussions in r/NTU"" or something along those lines wasn't enough to shift the blame to Reddit's unhinged discussions but rather since it was accompanied with Nadine's opinions on future actions that might be able to be taken against Ethan based on those uncontrolled rumors (Ethan wanting to get a confession out of the victim, for example). With that, this lawsuit became scarily viable for Ethan to pursue because as difficult as it is to prove romantic feelings weren't involved in the court of law, it's also as difficult if not harder to prove that they were, especially considering Nadine's position as an NUS and not an NTU student, not even minding the possibility of being a SU student that might see or know people that have seen Ethan's behaviors.
 
 But I want to stress that Ethan's public perception, which is also shared by me, is dogwater thanks to this lawsuit. I get it, Ethan is *probably* trying to recoup reputational and potential future loss of career fees, which unfortunately I think is fair as this post was directly put up on LinkedIn for a reason I presume. But not even giving her an option to just take down the post or settle things personally without immediately giving her a lawsuit threat is insanely scummy to me and probably a lot of you. Because it looks to us as if it's not Ethan trying to get back his lost career and reputation, it looks a lot like he's trying to cause the most damage to Nadine financially because he can.
 
 What's happening to Nadine is insanely saddening and Ethan's a piece of crap, but I can only wonder that the reason this happened in the first place is due to the unsubstantiated accusations laid upon Ethan here on r/NTU under the guise of anonymity influencing Nadine's decision to put the LinkedIn post with those claims forward to begin with.
 
 &#x200B;
 
 Edit: Mods have restored Nadine's comment and it seems that the initial email was a warning letter. My point still stands, that's a scummy move, I don't think anyone would just fork over $100,000 without a fight or even apologize for something that at the time seemed like reasonable statements, which I *predict* is something Ethan's lawyers knew and sent the letter with that in mind (therefore pressuring her to fight and exhausting her finances).","Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

 Ethan does not need the money. Moreover, the linkedin post damages could, however it is improbable that it would amount to 100k. What he is trying to do is to teach nadine a lesson. Rightfully so, because she is no longer an adolescent, and the fact that she is studying law but does not know the consequences of her actions makes it worse. Yes, it is a power play from ethan. He knows it is highly unlikely she will be able to pay the amount he asked for. This also directs the attention away from the original alcohol inicident. 
 
 At the end of the day, no matter how much of a scummy move this is, ethan did not break any law, however nadine did. All i can say is good luck and hopefully nadine learns from this and can find a donor somehow to save her.",0,0

Unfortunately I've encountered many fellow SGeans that outright support Israel so it's hard not to be on the auto-defence for this kind of thinf. 
 
 I think the reason there is such a strong sentiment is because while it's not the most recent, it has a very major resurgence in recent times and has been an ongoing conflict, and while it may not affect the objectively greatest number of people, when you consider the proportion compared to the Palestine population √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù and particularly horrific statistics like the number of dead children and infants, the number of bloodlines that have ended, the many documented (photo/video evidence, Israeli soldiers proudly talking abt what they've done) heinous war crimes √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù it shows as an especially egregious situation thay desperately needs to be stopped. While other conflicts may not be """"as bad"""", the genocide of Palestine is a very pressing situation because if nothing continues to be done by those in power there is a genuine chance that the gebocide will succeed at the rate of deaths and bombings √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù not to mention the fact that Israel is even bombing other surrounding countries like Lebanon that have nothing to do with it!
 
 To compare with the Russia-Ukraine thing again, Ukraine was still able to receive support from other countries/NATO and able to escape to other countries. Palestinians are trapped within their occupied country and a huge majority of the aid that people are trying to send are being blocked/cut off by Israel. 
 
 Another aspect is definitely social media, since Israel has been trying to silence Palestinian voices online talking about the truth of their situation, many outsiders are using their own platforms to speak out for them where Palestinians cannot. I do admit there is a bit of an issue of people focusing on Palestine alone when there are other huge issues √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù such as what's going on in Congo currently, which is absolutely horrific √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù that also need people's attention, but I guess it's better than nothing, honestly.",0,0

 he is guilty of nothing, despite you trying to to couch it in ""legalistic"" jargon. Hello, how can one be guilty when there is no law in the books for the crime you are talking about? There was no contact whatsoever and no outrage of modesty, indecent comments etc. 
 
 You are simply profiling him - like a woman who allege a guy is sexually harassing her because he look in her direction for too long, and so happens his eyes are in the direction of her boobs. 
 
 If what Ethan did can be charged as sexual crime, then a burglar who force his way into a young woman home at night can be given the additional charge of potential rape/molest/outrage of modesty simply because it contains the element of young woman, alone and force into her home at night which might be similar situation where such forceful sex crime occurred. Then we can also automatically assume they have the intention to rape but copped out at the last minute, because think of all the women sleeping at home at night. 
 
 That is why Ethan is suing to clear his name of this mischaracterization, to let it be publicly known - disprove rumor mongers and cancellers. Ethan did the right thing to clear his name","This is an incredibly baffling and emotionally-charged response to my comment. I did not say he was guilty of a crime.

Yet again, the speaker of Parliament has resigned, over a scandal which the PM knew about for years but did not disclose.
 
 That's what LHY said. No mention of corruption or preferential treatment towards the ministers. SLA paying for renovations are true, because they are supposed to maintain the houses. The Ministers did also pay for their own renovations as well, but it does not make the previous statement false. Shanmugam is indeed the minister that directly oversees SLA, so that checks out. Trees were felled too. None of what Shan accused LHY of saying is here, none of what LHY said is untrue also.

 We have enough examples given in this thread on how many components of our lives are 'complicit' so what do we do? 
 
 2. I think why some of us prescribe this as a religious issue is because some lofty individuals have very often determined our moral compass by how loud we seem to be on social platforms. From what I can see, most of the Muslims are comparatively driven about this issue due to the Muslim population in Gaza. Yes there are other religious populations but the majority of them are Muslim. 
 
 Am I wrong if I am not as vocal about it as you are on the issue? We are people of different backgrounds and different life experiences. Say I am a Chinese Taoist taxi driver who has been poor my whole life, my platform would be devoted to protesting about the 9% gst. Am I wrong if I don't connect to the Gazans as much as you? Isn't it the same for the Muslims who have absolutely no regard for the ongoing civil war and daily death tolls in Myanmar? Can I blame the Muslims if they don't connect to the people living there and aren't as vocal as I am? Yes it is a humanitarian issue in Gaza but am I criticised if I am seemingly less committed to the cause since I connect to other issues more?
 
 So who are we to point at each other, prescribing moral cues, when perhaps you have ignored only 1 less death than me?","Thank you for your reply. I typed a long reply to this, but not sure why, but it wasnt saved as a draft when i exited. hais. 
 
 Anyway, lemme summarise my thoughts briefly. Particularly on the religious part.
 
 i think our curriculum teaches us to think of any geopolitical issue from a religious lens as the idea of harmony triumphs all here. Religion might tether Muslims here - but it is not the main reason. It would help us if we understood this nuance. 
 
 secondly, i think I am not attacking you for not having a stance on this. much less, on supporting Israel. I am simply wondering why ppl who have a stance on this are infantilised as religious? Is that the only thing motivating their stance? Humanity doesnt come into play.
 
 I think the classic SGrean mindset of ""it doesnt affect me, why should i care"" is at full speed here. one redditor even has something nasty to say along this lines if u go down a few comments. my view is -- why doesnt humanity come into play as a factor here?
