I don't blame Ethan for using those tactics because that's really just how it is, and he was also in a very emotionally charged and even vulnerable state. For all you know, the lawyer might recommend these actions instead of taking his instructions.
 
 I believe people like Nadine should not be let off so easily with just a slap on the wrist for the kind of damage she can do. It is ridiculous that people think it's OK or trivial that she did what she did. No one has imagined a scenario where they were accused of a crime they did not commit, and some random mentally ill girl makes a LinkedIn post that goes viral. Just a simple ""sorry"" and a few thousand dollars is not justice. But yes, $100,000 is ridiculous, but that was never my focus. As for the apology in the newspaper - I don't feel it's overboard. I've seen people put up apologies for trivial stuff. She is accusing him of being a sexual predator and criminal and has stated her intentions of threatening his future career. It's Ethan's right to ask for what makes him feel whole, and whether the judge agrees or not is another matter.","Agreed as well and completely valid opinion.
 
 I don't really understand what you mean on apologies being overboard. If it's Nadine's I think that's fair play too, hell if Ethan wanted his reputation restored that's a great way to do so after one-on-one discussion on the facts.
 
 If it's Ethan's, I thought it was just disingenuous ([this one](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-ntu-student-leader-apologises-for-alcohol-related-incident-involving-female-junior)). It feels so corporatized, it doesn't feel like an apology but an attempt at defense. I think that it was correct to reach out to the Straits, especially if the issue had blown up, but the wordings he used were robotic at best and didn't feel like an admission of guilt and a promise to do better, but as if he'd always been better and that he had done nothing wrong. 
 
 Which I think as many of us here on the forum would say, inadvertently spiking someone is a gross violation of consent and obviously, something wrong. But as many of the non-radical ones on this forum also agree, isn't something to lose your career over, but definitely something to be punished for in some way (which never really happened apparently after the whole faux 5-week SU suspension fiasco).",0,0

 I'm just saying the police won't involve themselves in this because no crime was committed as far as everybody's aware.

Jesus Christ.","Lots of things that are ""not illegal"" but still very concerning precursors where there is a need to step in and do some kind of re-education or correction, in this case where NTU did none. Like if a child exhibits zero empty, takes delight in harming those weaker than him, has a particular liking for setting things on fire, can't take no for an answer, tries choking a peer etc those are extremely concerning things that can lead to serial killer behaviour. You don't just leave it be like NTU did. And if NTU is incapable of correcting this kind of behaviour (as they have repeatedly shown), someone else needs to step in. 
 
 Besides, NTU is an organisation we give a significant amounts of money to. By your logic, we can't complain if NTU doesn't put the money towards building 10 more gardens and doesn't care about student wellbeing and teaching quality since it's ""not illegal""? 
 
 To reduce his behaviour to the equivalent of cheating just shows how much you don't care about crime done on women and the events leading up to it. You keep saying you're not defending him but that's like 90% of what you use your account for. You don't want to go into whether or not his actions were correct, even though it is obviously wrong, and try to play the centrist. This isn't neutrality and objectivity.

 Sounds like she made the unwise decision of trying to fight it out instead of apologising unreservedly the initial LoD and suggesting a token sum to settle. If she had done that, he would have dropped case since it's not cheap for him either to proceed beyond LoD.
 
 Girl ah girl, why you follow all the upvoted Redditor comments asking you to go and fight? Already warned that doing that was terrible unwise and would cause you to end up in a world of hurt. Those jokers who gave wrong advice can just delete comments (I see a lot of them already) or make new account.
 
 Sorry but there is no chance you are winning this case, and 2 things are big knocks against you:
 
 1, you are a year 2 lawyer, meaning you'll definitely be looked at by the judge as someone who should have known better.
 
 2: all the ""helpful"" Redditors who so happily went to sound out how they thought Ethan was a douche *after* your LinkedIn post. Because all those ""helpful"" posts have became ammo for him: proof that his reputation had been damaged by you. Normally I'll advise you to ask these unhelpful helpful people to take down, but pointless by now as his lawyers would definitely have already captured.
 
 What you can do now is just apologise unreservedly and offer a token sum of compensation (the price of the LoD, 1k maybe) and hope he has the mercy to stop the case. Stop listening to bad advice - it's not their money that's going to be lost. It's yours.",0,0

With that, this lawsuit became scarily viable for Ethan to pursue because as difficult as it is to prove romantic feelings weren't involved in the court of law, it's also as difficult if not harder to prove that they were, especially considering Nadine's position as an NUS and not an NTU student, not even minding the possibility of being a SU student that might see or know people that have seen Ethan's behaviors.

 To clarify, I messed up the terminology the first time and mistakenly said I was being sued, when it was merely a Letter of Demand. Which is like a warning letter. After my lawyer responded, they said they would sue. And now they have mounted the /actual/ lawsuit. I apologize for not being able to respond to the comments from last time, because I was being PM'ed immense amounts of shit. Likewise, this time I'll be avoiding social media and just posting any updates on my IG. My Reddit DMs are closed. You can call me whatever you like, make rape and death threats, I heard it all the first time and I won't be even reading them this time.
 
 I just want to mention here that I will not be setting up a GFM, I don't believe in taking money from people especially because many people reading this who've expressed willingness to donate are university students just like me, and that's just not the right thing to do imo. I don't want to take anybody's money. IF YOU SEE A GFM, IT IS NOT ME. 
 
 At this stage, ""just apologize"" to Ethan is not going to work, because the lawsuit has commenced, and he may ask for damages, similar to the original Letter of Demand asking for $100k and for me to pay for a $7k advertising spot to post a public apology. That's really all I can say right now. At this point, no matter what happens, I have lost already, because I'll have to fork out money to defend against this.

 1. there is no way he will get 100k if he goes to trial. 100k lies within the range of defaming public figures like LKY and LHL. he is nowhere near a public figure, and im sure your lawyers have advised you accordingly.
 
 
 2. his entire strat is very transparent - commence proceedings, make you incur expensive legal fees until you are desperate, and you have to settle on his terms. i leave that to your lawyers to advise, but at this stage you don't really have leverage to get a good deal. unless -
 
 
 3. you plead defence of truth / justification / fair comment, and take out discovery application against him and ask for all the relevant documents to prove that whatever you are saying is true or fair comment. see the Rachel Wong defamation case against Olivia Wu, whereby Olivia got a discovery order for Rachel to disclose all her (among others) text messages to prove her infidelity. these documents will be part of the public record. put the allegations against him solely in issue before the court. but again, you should get your lawyers to advise you accordingly. 
 
 
 legal fees can get very expensive and i hope you got a good and kind lawyer willing to do some low bono for you. all the best!
 
 PS: dont forget, he is incurring legal fees as well. the longer you drag it out, the more expensive his legal fees get. it's a matter of who blinks first.",0,0

 I think the reason there is such a strong sentiment is because while it's not the most recent, it has a very major resurgence in recent times and has been an ongoing conflict, and while it may not affect the objectively greatest number of people, when you consider the proportion compared to the Palestine population â€” and particularly horrific statistics like the number of dead children and infants, the number of bloodlines that have ended, the many documented (photo/video evidence, Israeli soldiers proudly talking abt what they've done) heinous war crimes â€” it shows as an especially egregious situation thay desperately needs to be stopped. While other conflicts may not be """"as bad"""", the genocide of Palestine is a very pressing situation because if nothing continues to be done by those in power there is a genuine chance that the gebocide will succeed at the rate of deaths and bombings â€” not to mention the fact that Israel is even bombing other surrounding countries like Lebanon that have nothing to do with it!
 
 To compare with the Russia-Ukraine thing again, Ukraine was still able to receive support from other countries/NATO and able to escape to other countries. Palestinians are trapped within their occupied country and a huge majority of the aid that people are trying to send are being blocked/cut off by Israel. 
 
 Another aspect is definitely social media, since Israel has been trying to silence Palestinian voices online talking about the truth of their situation, many outsiders are using their own platforms to speak out for them where Palestinians cannot. I do admit there is a bit of an issue of people focusing on Palestine alone when there are other huge issues â€” such as what's going on in Congo currently, which is absolutely horrific â€” that also need people's attention, but I guess it's better than nothing, honestly.","to me, nothing continues to be done because globally, Palestine is far more useful to the middle eastern states as a pawn in continuing to ostracise Israel, especially considering the recent deals they have signed with some of the Muslim majority states, and they were close to signing alot more, that would have given them the upper hand in influencing politics in the region. Also Israel hitting Lebanon because of rocket attacks from them. 
 
 Also security. i wouldnt be surprised that privately none of the Arab states wants any Palestinian refugees after Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Egypt. But of course in public they must still be seen to support Palestine.",0,0

 The main issue was always that that LinkedIn post, even when prefaced by saying ""this information came from the discussions in r/NTU"" or something along those lines wasn't enough to shift the blame to Reddit's unhinged discussions but rather since it was accompanied with Nadine's opinions on future actions that might be able to be taken against Ethan based on those uncontrolled rumors (Ethan wanting to get a confession out of the victim, for example). With that, this lawsuit became scarily viable for Ethan to pursue because as difficult as it is to prove romantic feelings weren't involved in the court of law, it's also as difficult if not harder to prove that they were, especially considering Nadine's position as an NUS and not an NTU student, not even minding the possibility of being a SU student that might see or know people that have seen Ethan's behaviors.
 
 But I want to stress that Ethan's public perception, which is also shared by me, is dogwater thanks to this lawsuit. I get it, Ethan is *probably* trying to recoup reputational and potential future loss of career fees, which unfortunately I think is fair as this post was directly put up on LinkedIn for a reason I presume. But not even giving her an option to just take down the post or settle things personally without immediately giving her a lawsuit threat is insanely scummy to me and probably a lot of you. Because it looks to us as if it's not Ethan trying to get back his lost career and reputation, it looks a lot like he's trying to cause the most damage to Nadine financially because he can.
 
 What's happening to Nadine is insanely saddening and Ethan's a piece of crap, but I can only wonder that the reason this happened in the first place is due to the unsubstantiated accusations laid upon Ethan here on r/NTU under the guise of anonymity influencing Nadine's decision to put the LinkedIn post with those claims forward to begin with.
 
 &#x200B;
 
 Edit: Mods have restored Nadine's comment and it seems that the initial email was a warning letter. My point still stands, that's a scummy move, I don't think anyone would just fork over $100,000 without a fight or even apologize for something that at the time seemed like reasonable statements, which I *predict* is something Ethan's lawyers knew and sent the letter with that in mind (therefore pressuring her to fight and exhausting her finances).","I don't understand what Ethan's trying to do honestly. This case wasn't even in my radar until he sent that warning letter which frankly just added more fuel to the fire. Then when the Linkedin post has already been removed, he still wants to go ahead with suing for 100k? 
 
 Thereby prolonging this whole situation and bringing it to public attention again? If Ethan really wants to salvage his reputation, once the linkedin post was removed he should have just quietly moved on (or maybe also give a more sincere apology before keeping silent on this whole thing). The more attention he brings to this, the more his reputation is questioned.",2,0

 My thoughts on the situation are just that it's improper and proliferates negative stereotypes, especially for a person in a position of power. People who initially disagree with it might end up agreeing just to stay in good graces with the others in the group. If such a dynamic exists, especially within a group chat that supposedly represents the student body, it's vile.

 2. getting off social media might help. please do reach out to a trusted professional (therapist/counsellor) if it's within your capacity to do so too. 
 
 3. you will see this through. you will go on exchange and have fun overseas.

 To clarify, I messed up the terminology the first time and mistakenly said I was being sued, when it was merely a Letter of Demand. Which is like a warning letter. After my lawyer responded, they said they would sue. And now they have mounted the /actual/ lawsuit. I apologize for not being able to respond to the comments from last time, because I was being PM'ed immense amounts of shit. Likewise, this time I'll be avoiding social media and just posting any updates on my IG. My Reddit DMs are closed. You can call me whatever you like, make rape and death threats, I heard it all the first time and I won't be even reading them this time.
 
 I just want to mention here that I will not be setting up a GFM, I don't believe in taking money from people especially because many people reading this who've expressed willingness to donate are university students just like me, and that's just not the right thing to do imo. I don't want to take anybody's money. IF YOU SEE A GFM, IT IS NOT ME. 
 
 At this stage, ""just apologize"" to Ethan is not going to work, because the lawsuit has commenced, and he may ask for damages, similar to the original Letter of Demand asking for $100k and for me to pay for a $7k advertising spot to post a public apology. That's really all I can say right now. At this point, no matter what happens, I have lost already, because I'll have to fork out money to defend against this.

He make someone go drunk and he could have done something to that poor girl. People need to understand just because the girl was not sexually assaulted, doesn't mean he can go around making girls drunk. It could happened, hence possibly her reason for doxxing him since the student council covered up the incident. 
 
 Eaten making that lawsuit of 100k is ridiculous. What, his entire life is destroyed? By the truth? Or because he simply thinks that everything is a joke? The girl told him so many times to give her water and he straight up give the girl alcohol. Like why would you do that?
 
 Also that girl that exposed eaten ong should have been more prepared. She is a law student, obviously she should have known that the suing would come eventually.

 Except: ""A recent study has found that individuals with higher levels of narcissistic traits are more likely to be involved in feminist activism. This research suggests that for some, activism may serve not just as a platform for societal change, but also as a means to fulfill personal, egocentric needs. The findings have been published in Current Psychology.
 
 The study was inspired by the idea that while many engage in activism for altruistic reasons or due to direct personal impact by the issues at hand, others might be motivated by less noble desires, such as the fulfillment of narcissistic needs. This notion aligns with the concept that activism can be used as a vehicle for individuals to achieve personal gains, such as attention, status, or fame.
 
 â€œBased on the results of a previous study, in which we investigated the relationship between dark personality traits (e.g., narcissism) and anti-sexual assault activism, we were interested to further explore the notion that some individuals may be involved in certain forms of activism (i.e., feminist activism) to (merely) **satisfy their own ego-focused needs (instead of prosocial goals)**,â€ explained study authors Ann Krispenz, a postdoctoral associate, and Professor Alex Bertrams, the head of the Division of Educational Psychology of the University of Bern.""",0,0

 I'm also from Social Sciences but not soci so pardon my lack of understanding and if I jump the gun in my chain of logic for this. As for power dynamics and history. In short, is it just the implication that racism essentially brings systemic discrimination and suppression towards certain groups for a trait that they have no control over. And this would naturally have far reaching effects generations into the future which is where we are now, and the problem does still persist to every extent. So is it being implied that for innate negative prejudice against a group to be perceived as racism or harmful, it must carry that history of oppression.

 1. The poster is NOT saying u should not apply to the uni or u should protest. It is simply saying you should be aware of this. Why are people so incredibly affected by this? NTU's support for Israel is well documented, as stated here. And Israel, is definitely killing civilians, aligning with definiton of genocide, so NTU is complicit. The poster is not blaming u for this, it is empowering you to know this. Knowledge is power, critical thinking is in short supply. Pls set aside your ego, and consider this objectively. 
 
 2. Why are ppl here making this a religious issue? Ask yourself this - yes, religion might tether some ppl here to the tragedy, but do u really think ppl are voicing out their opinons cuz of their religion? Or are they seeing ppl murdered and advocating for a stop? If you are informed by a patriotic sense of duty to nation, making you analyse this with a relgious lens -- arent you informed by a religious fervour to your nation more than ppl are infleunced by religion to stop civilains dying?
 
 3. Lastly, how did this comment make you feel? Are you offended? Why? Is it because I am challening your beliefs or as someone here put it, being ""fanatical to the Palestinian side"". Why is being against killing civilians fanatism? And before anyone brings this talking point up - I am against the killing of civilains in all sides. I condemn Hamas, and I condemn Bibi and Bengevir's Israel. I do not codemn Palestinians and Israelis. 
 
 I am proud to be aSingaporean BUT I recognise that my country is unbashedly supporting genocide. Sit with this line for a bit. What this means is that, you can feel a certain sense of belonging to your community, and at the same time be able criticise it. If you disagree with -- wont you call this religious fanatism? 
 
 I am keen to hear your perspectives.","1. The casual use of the word genocide is devaluing it as a word. Statistically, if this was a genocide, it is the lousiest and most inefficient genocide in human history. Seriously, tens of thousands of airstrikes/bombs and ONLY 20k deaths? Keep in mind just 1 bomb can level NTU Hive. 
 
 Knowledge is power. Correct. So use the word â€˜genocideâ€™ appropriately. Go and critically think about the death toll vs ordinance drop. If it was a genocide, death toll would easily be over 2 million for the same number of bombs dropped. Refugee camps and hospitals would have been bombed to oblivion. Water would have been cut off permanently. 
 
 Is whats happening a tragedy? Yes. Is it a genocide? No. 
 
 U want to know whats a real modern genocide? Go and google â€˜Mariupolâ€™. Absolute systematic indiscriminate destruction of the entire city. 
 
 2. Then why only on Israel - Hamas conflict? Houthis in Yemen has been over a decade. North Korea on its own civilians has been over half a century. China in Xinjiang has also been a decade. Or Myanmar Junta. Yet you dont see this kind of posters targetting the other parties. Why? Anti-Semites. They are the ones making this a religious issue. 
 
 
 3. Again, why suddenly target Israel conflict only? Whats so different here compared to Myanmar/Yemen/China/NK? Main common difference is that Israelis are mostly Jewish.

 Yeah, she can drop out and pay that at least.
 
 >We're talking about your assumption of her financial means. Not Ethan.
 
 My point is nobody needs to assume anything. She defamed, she gotta pay the damages. You are claiming that it is a bad look to claim damages from someone who obviously cannot pay so he will get nothing in the end, but it is you who is doing the assumption here. 
 
 She simply has gotta pay. Ethan can feel sorry for her and drop charges if she can't afford it, but he does not need to make any assumptions of her financial means like you are doing. 
 
 > The average household income in Singapore is around 13k. A 100k payment is 8-9 months of salary and not a ""measly amount"". This means that the average Singapore family could afford Ethan's demand, by not eating for 9 months.
 
 Sounds very affordable to me. If you can afford a HDB, you can afford that. I'm sure Ethan can work out an installment plan if that's what you need. But I guess not, since she straight up paid 5 figures for a lawyer while crying about how guilty she feels. 
 
 You seem pretty lost on this, let's get you back on track:
 1) She defamed. Now she has to pay damages.
 2) You say it is unreasonable to make her pay damages and that he won't get anything from her because she is poor, but this baseless assumption on your part. 
 3) She has not given any indication that she cannot afford anything. In fact she seems pretty intend in doubling down and going through with the lawsuit, showing no remorse.
