 1. The poster is NOT saying u should not apply to the uni or u should protest. It is simply saying you should be aware of this. Why are people so incredibly affected by this? NTU's support for Israel is well documented, as stated here. And Israel, is definitely killing civilians, aligning with definiton of genocide, so NTU is complicit. The poster is not blaming u for this, it is empowering you to know this. Knowledge is power, critical thinking is in short supply. Pls set aside your ego, and consider this objectively. 
 
 2. Why are ppl here making this a religious issue? Ask yourself this - yes, religion might tether some ppl here to the tragedy, but do u really think ppl are voicing out their opinons cuz of their religion? Or are they seeing ppl murdered and advocating for a stop? If you are informed by a patriotic sense of duty to nation, making you analyse this with a relgious lens -- arent you informed by a religious fervour to your nation more than ppl are infleunced by religion to stop civilains dying?
 
 3. Lastly, how did this comment make you feel? Are you offended? Why? Is it because I am challening your beliefs or as someone here put it, being ""fanatical to the Palestinian side"". Why is being against killing civilians fanatism? And before anyone brings this talking point up - I am against the killing of civilains in all sides. I condemn Hamas, and I condemn Bibi and Bengevir's Israel. I do not codemn Palestinians and Israelis. 
 
 I am proud to be aSingaporean BUT I recognise that my country is unbashedly supporting genocide. Sit with this line for a bit. What this means is that, you can feel a certain sense of belonging to your community, and at the same time be able criticise it. If you disagree with -- wont you call this religious fanatism?

 Ethan Ong, a member of the Students' Union, fed his victim a large quantity of alcohol in a bid to get a romantic confession out of them.

 Truth:
 http://soapbox.sg/2023/09/24/disgraced-former-ntusu-vice-president-out-of-union-presidential-bid-new-candidate-emerges/
 
 The drinking session was held on Oct 15, 2022 in Ethanâ€™s Hall of Residence room after a union committee meeting, according to Xinruo. She said a total of six union members attended, including her, Ethan, then-NTUSU president, then-NTUSU chief of staff and two other union Exco members. 
 
 It also noted that a complaint, which was filed in September, did not report any form of sexual misconduct and the investigation also did not find any sexual misconduct as alleged in some social media posts. â€œThe university is concerned by some comments posted online and urges online users to refrain from making speculative and unsubstantiated allegations,â€ said NTU.

 To clarify, I messed up the terminology the first time and mistakenly said I was being sued, when it was merely a Letter of Demand. Which is like a warning letter. After my lawyer responded, they said they would sue. And now they have mounted the /actual/ lawsuit. I apologize for not being able to respond to the comments from last time, because I was being PM'ed immense amounts of shit. Likewise, this time I'll be avoiding social media and just posting any updates on my IG. My Reddit DMs are closed. You can call me whatever you like, make rape and death threats, I heard it all the first time and I won't be even reading them this time.
 
 I just want to mention here that I will not be setting up a GFM, I don't believe in taking money from people especially because many people reading this who've expressed willingness to donate are university students just like me, and that's just not the right thing to do imo. I don't want to take anybody's money. IF YOU SEE A GFM, IT IS NOT ME. 
 
 At this stage, ""just apologize"" to Ethan is not going to work, because the lawsuit has commenced, and he may ask for damages, similar to the original Letter of Demand asking for $100k and for me to pay for a $7k advertising spot to post a public apology. That's really all I can say right now. At this point, no matter what happens, I have lost already, because I'll have to fork out money to defend against this. And it is my parents' money, which ramps up the guilt. 
 
 Thanks for reading if you got this far. This is all I have to say.

 I think the reason there is such a strong sentiment is because while it's not the most recent, it has a very major resurgence in recent times and has been an ongoing conflict, and while it may not affect the objectively greatest number of people, when you consider the proportion compared to the Palestine population â€” and particularly horrific statistics like the number of dead children and infants, the number of bloodlines that have ended, the many documented (photo/video evidence, Israeli soldiers proudly talking abt what they've done) heinous war crimes â€” it shows as an especially egregious situation thay desperately needs to be stopped. While other conflicts may not be """"as bad"""", the genocide of Palestine is a very pressing situation because if nothing continues to be done by those in power there is a genuine chance that the gebocide will succeed at the rate of deaths and bombings â€” not to mention the fact that Israel is even bombing other surrounding countries like Lebanon that have nothing to do with it!
 
 To compare with the Russia-Ukraine thing again, Ukraine was still able to receive support from other countries/NATO and able to escape to other countries. Palestinians are trapped within their occupied country and a huge majority of the aid that people are trying to send are being blocked/cut off by Israel. 
 
 Another aspect is definitely social media, since Israel has been trying to silence Palestinian voices online talking about the truth of their situation, many outsiders are using their own platforms to speak out for them where Palestinians cannot. I do admit there is a bit of an issue of people focusing on Palestine alone when there are other huge issues â€” such as what's going on in Congo currently, which is absolutely horrific â€” that also need people's attention, but I guess it's better than nothing, honestly.",What are your thoughts about those who call for the destruction of Israel and say they have no right to exist?,0,0

 >The issue is not about Ethan's right to sue. It is about your original logic that she should ""just pay"". If she can't afford, she cannot ""just pay"". If the 100k is a ridiculous amount, she should not ""just pay"".
 
 My original logic is she should just pay if she is not remorseful and unwilling to make amends. If she can't afford it, she should be looking for a way out. Clearly she can ""just pay"" since she is fighting the suit by lawyering up. No apology to be seen and she has already paid a 5 figure sum to lawyers already.
 
 >""100k is spare change to her"" is completely your speculation. If she has to drop out of school or declare bankruptcy, it is obviously not spare change. Is something wrong with you, why are you suggesting two logically contradictory possibilities.
 
 She already paid a 5 figure sum and is ready to pay more. She admitted that she has already lost, as she either has to pay Ethan 100k or pay her lawyers that amount. That doesn't seem to phase her much, all those financial worries you mentioned doesn't even exist in her mind.

 I'm also from Social Sciences but not soci so pardon my lack of understanding and if I jump the gun in my chain of logic for this. As for power dynamics and history.

And this would naturally have far reaching effects generations into the future which is where we are now, and the problem does still persist to every extent.

393,k5i4q53,k5i2nka,234,232.0,"I don't think defending yourself from defamation is scummy. That being said, there are better ways to do this when you're trying to save face or your reputation. I call back to the initial Letter of Demand, that demands Nadine hand over $100,000 regardless of her action to apologize and take down the post. That's where I'd say is going over the line, I think at the point where you commit to a public apology to the extent of big public news providers and the deletion of the initial LinkedIn post is where at the very least you can clear some things up efficiently.
 
 Think about it this way, if this wasn't a method to scrape money or make an example out of someone by financially exhausting them and truly to protect himself from defamation then in Ethan's Letter of Demand it would have taken a more appropriate approach, linger the $100,000 if the demands aren't meant instead of enforcing it anyhow and invite for discussion. Theoretically this should be enough pressure for Nadine to care without coercing her into trying to fight back and incurring legal fees. Nadine at that point was his biggest third-party detractor, if he wants to clear up his name, an apology after discussions of the truths of the matter by that detractor would be more efficient at recovering his name, no?
 
 Yes, people can consider the temporary reputational damages to be compensated via the enforced $100,000, but think of it down the line when this news becomes old news and Ethan pursues a career. In this case, investigations into Ethan's backgrounds would see that they were embroiled in controversy and the situation was subsequently rectified with what truly happened if he sought for discussion.
 
 All that said, all this would be viable for Ethan... If he would've actually put up a proper apology instead of a corporatized statement on the Straits Times. So yeah, defending yourself? Fair play. Can I still say it's scummy with the methods involved? I can and think that my interpretation is just. 
 
 You can disagree if you want, it's your opinion, you can defend it too with analysis, or not I'm not going to judge you, it's your life. I'm just adding to the discussion to try to add the grey perspective that it isn't one side is wrong the other is right, or which is more wrong than who, I'm trying to get people to understand that you can admit Ethan is not the best human being while also understanding how the lawsuit is fair even if it utilized what I'd call scummy practices.","Thanks for taking the time to break it down. I actually agree with you completely. It's a balanced view. I don't blame Ethan for using those tactics because that's really just how it is, and he was also in a very emotionally charged and even vulnerable state. For all you know, the lawyer might recommend these actions instead of taking his instructions.
 
 I believe people like Nadine should not be let off so easily with just a slap on the wrist for the kind of damage she can do. It is ridiculous that people think it's OK or trivial that she did what she did. No one has imagined a scenario where they were accused of a crime they did not commit, and some random mentally ill girl makes a LinkedIn post that goes viral. Just a simple ""sorry"" and a few thousand dollars is not justice. But yes, $100,000 is ridiculous, but that was never my focus. As for the apology in the newspaper - I don't feel it's overboard. I've seen people put up apologies for trivial stuff. She is accusing him of being a sexual predator and criminal and has stated her intentions of threatening his future career. It's Ethan's right to ask for what makes him feel whole, and whether the judge agrees or not is another matter.",0,0

379,k5f2c7r,k5enx8u,233,232.0,"What's happening to Nadine is really sad but my main thing is that this was foreseen.
 
 The main issue was always that that LinkedIn post, even when prefaced by saying ""this information came from the discussions in r/NTU"" or something along those lines wasn't enough to shift the blame to Reddit's unhinged discussions but rather since it was accompanied with Nadine's opinions on future actions that might be able to be taken against Ethan based on those uncontrolled rumors (Ethan wanting to get a confession out of the victim, for example). With that, this lawsuit became scarily viable for Ethan to pursue because as difficult as it is to prove romantic feelings weren't involved in the court of law, it's also as difficult if not harder to prove that they were, especially considering Nadine's position as an NUS and not an NTU student, not even minding the possibility of being a SU student that might see or know people that have seen Ethan's behaviors.
 
 But I want to stress that Ethan's public perception, which is also shared by me, is dogwater thanks to this lawsuit. I get it, Ethan is *probably* trying to recoup reputational and potential future loss of career fees, which unfortunately I think is fair as this post was directly put up on LinkedIn for a reason I presume. But not even giving her an option to just take down the post or settle things personally without immediately giving her a lawsuit threat is insanely scummy to me and probably a lot of you. Because it looks to us as if it's not Ethan trying to get back his lost career and reputation, it looks a lot like he's trying to cause the most damage to Nadine financially because he can.
 
 What's happening to Nadine is insanely saddening and Ethan's a piece of crap, but I can only wonder that the reason this happened in the first place is due to the unsubstantiated accusations laid upon Ethan here on r/NTU under the guise of anonymity influencing Nadine's decision to put the LinkedIn post with those claims forward to begin with.

 Edit: Mods have restored Nadine's comment and it seems that the initial email was a warning letter. My point still stands, that's a scummy move, I don't think anyone would just fork over $100,000 without a fight or even apologize for something that at the time seemed like reasonable statements, which I *predict* is something Ethan's lawyers knew and sent the letter with that in mind (therefore pressuring her to fight and exhausting her finances).",The moral of the story is not to make comments based on hear say and online forum.,0,0

 Ethan Ong, a member of the Students' Union, fed his victim a large quantity of alcohol in a bid to get a romantic confession out of them.

 The drinking session was held on Oct 15, 2022 in Ethanâ€™s Hall of Residence room after a union committee meeting, according to Xinruo. She said a total of six union members attended, including her, Ethan, then-NTUSU president, then-NTUSU chief of staff and two other union Exco members. 
 
 It also noted that a complaint, which was filed in September, did not report any form of sexual misconduct and the investigation also did not find any sexual misconduct as alleged in some social media posts. â€œThe university is concerned by some comments posted online and urges online users to refrain from making speculative and unsubstantiated allegations,â€ said NTU.

Using some napkin math, even if 300k was utilised to subsidise food for financial aid, eg 2$ per meal subsidy thatâ€™s 150k meals. If 3k students qualify for financial aid, thatâ€™s just 50 meals subsidised per student. Which would last approximately 25 days assuming youâ€™re subsiding only lunch and dinner.

388,k5erh1u,k5enx8u,240,232.0,"What's happening to Nadine is really sad but my main thing is that this was foreseen.
 
 The main issue was always that that LinkedIn post, even when prefaced by saying ""this information came from the discussions in r/NTU"" or something along those lines wasn't enough to shift the blame to Reddit's unhinged discussions but rather since it was accompanied with Nadine's opinions on future actions that might be able to be taken against Ethan based on those uncontrolled rumors (Ethan wanting to get a confession out of the victim, for example). With that, this lawsuit became scarily viable for Ethan to pursue because as difficult as it is to prove romantic feelings weren't involved in the court of law, it's also as difficult if not harder to prove that they were, especially considering Nadine's position as an NUS and not an NTU student, not even minding the possibility of being a SU student that might see or know people that have seen Ethan's behaviors.
 
 But I want to stress that Ethan's public perception, which is also shared by me, is dogwater thanks to this lawsuit. I get it, Ethan is *probably* trying to recoup reputational and potential future loss of career fees, which unfortunately I think is fair as this post was directly put up on LinkedIn for a reason I presume. But not even giving her an option to just take down the post or settle things personally without immediately giving her a lawsuit threat is insanely scummy to me and probably a lot of you. Because it looks to us as if it's not Ethan trying to get back his lost career and reputation, it looks a lot like he's trying to cause the most damage to Nadine financially because he can.
 
 What's happening to Nadine is insanely saddening and Ethan's a piece of crap, but I can only wonder that the reason this happened in the first place is due to the unsubstantiated accusations laid upon Ethan here on r/NTU under the guise of anonymity influencing Nadine's decision to put the LinkedIn post with those claims forward to begin with.
 
 &#x200B;
 
 Edit: Mods have restored Nadine's comment and it seems that the initial email was a warning letter. My point still stands, that's a scummy move, I don't think anyone would just fork over $100,000 without a fight or even apologize for something that at the time seemed like reasonable statements, which I *predict* is something Ethan's lawyers knew and sent the letter with that in mind (therefore pressuring her to fight and exhausting her finances).",The only important comment,0,0

 Ethan does not need the money. Moreover, the linkedin post damages could, however it is improbable that it would amount to 100k. What he is trying to do is to teach nadine a lesson.

 Knowledge is power. Correct. So use the word â€˜genocideâ€™ appropriately. Go and critically think about the death toll vs ordinance drop.

 From what we see from the circumstances, Nadine is being hit by a lot of financial and mental troubles. Which at the very least is something Ethan *seems* to not have, at the very least financially. I find that extremely saddening, I don't want to see anyone get screwed over to the point of oblivion unless it's absolutely necessary and irredeemable, both for Nadine and Ethan.
