The argument many of these anti abortion people are making, is that life starts at conception. As in, the moment the egg is fertilized by sperm.

Now an IUD has two main ways it prevents pregnancy. The first one is that it changes cervical mucus so that it kills sperm when sperm gets there. This is very effective, but not 100% guaranteed success rate.

The other way IUD's prevent pregnancy is by changing the uterine wall so that if fertilization occurs, the egg cannot implant itself onto the uterine wall.

He is not arguing that killing sperm is murder, he is arguing that the second thing, is. Because a fertilized egg, according to these people, is already a living human being and you should not be allowed to terminate it. However an IUD will terminate it.","Right, I just figured it was a strawman argument.

They started on patriotism, wound up on abortion, and addressed no major points anywhere in between. All the while the woman burned most of the time by effectively saying a string of words that really had no coherence as any kind of singular thought.

Every thing she mentioned was its own entire concept and should have been discussed separately.

So, there obviously is no moderation, which there should have been to shut down the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna talk over you so everyone knows I‚Äôm right‚Äù bullsh*#.

Beyond that, the whole idea of saying something, and then NEITHER person in the debate diving into that and properly discussing it, leaves the whole thing unresolved.

This same thing happens on news interviews. It‚Äôs all for clicks and views and none of this is for serious discussion and it harms everyone.

There was a real chance to have a deep review of the conservative belief system and how fundamentally broken it is with these kids and that was missed entirely.

I really wish they would actually talk about ONE topic, not be allowed to go off topic, not be allowed to gish gallup, not be allowed to interrupt, and not be allowed to speak in anecdotes, rather they should be only allowed to speak with supporting, verifiable facts from reliable sources.

If that sort of thing were to happen, I think we could possibly break through some of the lies these people have been told and get to some actual reality.

As it is, it‚Äôs just made up talking points from the right based on whatever fox news said last week with zero fact based evidence and this guy basically in a roller coaster of nonsense trying his best to respond to whatever passing thought the opponent yammers out as they do their best not to let him speak.

It wasn‚Äôt just this woman, it was all of them. The whole thing is an exercise in frustration and since nothing of substance ever gets addressed, it just wound up deepening each sides resolve with no actual forward movement to common understanding or agreement.

I hate everything about the whole situation, but it makes for amazing rage bait and gets all the clicks and views, so here we all are talking about it.

If we can‚Äôt get away from click bait, how are we going to be able to take each other seriously?",2,0

205,lortgxo,loog0du,13,165.0,My father was one of them and he served the same amount of time as her father did.,"My father was a staunch, lifelong Republican. He enlisted in the Marines at 17, lied about his age, could‚Äôve just waited for his draft number to come up after turning 18, but he was ready to go to Vietnam. He served 6 tours there; he kept volunteering to go back, partly because he wanted to take the place of men who had wives and kids back home, and partly because he struggled to adjust after coming home. 

So. My entire childhood centered around his undiagnosed and untreated PTSD, because the military abandoned him. Back then, mental health was not a priority. Thank you for your service, now fuck off. So he self medicated with alcohol, which often caused violent outbursts and flashbacks. He‚Äôd mistake me for Viet Cong and beat me within an inch of my life regularly. 

But he was a true Patriot, right? 

At least he redeemed himself by voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016. He even went so far as to change his party affiliation. He‚Äôd been growing more disgusted by ‚Äúrepublican values‚Äù since the 80s and 90s, but Trump was the nail in that conservative coffin. If he hadn‚Äôt died in 2019, he‚Äôd have voted for Biden in 2020 and Harris this year, I know it. 

Since his passing, my mother, of all people, has gone full liberal. It‚Äôs absolutely insane to me, having grown up in a house where ‚Äúbleeding heart liberal‚Äù was considered an insult. She watches the news more than me these days, never Fox, only CNN, MSNBC and local news. She watches the debates. She watched the DNC.

I realise that this might be my communist indoctrination talking but I thought the idea of patriotism in America was centred on protecting individual freedoms from the tyranny of a big bad centralised government. But I seem to have got this wrong as what it actually means is local government legislating to define the rights of individuals under the guise that they have the right to frame freedoms because they are closer to them than the federal govt. How community minded nothing says patriotic like your neighbour taking away your individual freedoms. I mean after all it's my nations favourite past time. Shit sorry we're not talking about nineteenth century Britain. My Marxist mind is struggling.

Firstly that Republican patriotism is extremely performative. They tout freedom and liberty while trampling over freedom to make Healthcare decisions, freedom to live and express your gender as you feel, equal opportunity at wealth and the American dream. Or at least equal opportunity to make a sustainable living. They act like the Constitution is so important to them but they abandon it as soon as it contradicts with their agenda. Liberals may protest but that's not unpatriotic. That is free speech and it is extremely American. Book bannings prove that Republicans don't care about the ideals that they claim to stand for. They don't care about free speech, they care about the freedom to hate and discriminate. They don't care about the Constitution, they care about what it can do for them. Freedom of worship should not be under attack, but that goes for all religions. Nobody should say that you can't worship who you want where you want, but neither should schools be required to teach your kids religious values. Nor should America be expected to prop up any institution of religion as characteristic of American ideals. America is a melting pot of different races and religions, and none should be respected more than another. Another point for abortion is the separation of Church and State. Most non-religious people tend to be in favor of some level of abortion access, and even most religions allow for caveats (although this doesn't fully address the issue). You will probably not be aggressively pro-life unless you have a specifically evangelical Christian/conservative background. And non-Christian people should not be forced to live by Christian standards. Patriotism is not defined by conservative Christian values. In fact, these values contradict the very essence of what it means to be American. There are a lot more points that somebody far smarter than I could make. I'm not very good at debates and this is just off the top of my head.",0,0

He makes a cut and dry point that trump tried to overturn the American election process. 

One of her points was true to a point. In california, during the pandemic, the government prohibited meetings of over 6 people. Which stopped religious gathering. Both on private property and church property if there were more than 6 people in attendance.

Can we agree that when the government Rushes rules, they have a high likelihood of getting it wrong. Can we also agree that was a temporary measure to deal with extreme circumstances where not rushing out rules can cost american lives... can we also agree that the people making laws are hypocrites for making such extreme measures then not following them themselves....
