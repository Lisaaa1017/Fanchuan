American example: BUILD THE WALL. every idiot and their grandma can understand that people get stopped by walls. but just a wall won't stop anyone, they dig a tunnel or get a boat. and that is completely overlooking WHY people are coming to America. want to stop illegal immigration? make sure that they don't want to leave their own home. that is the only way you stop illegal's coming over the border somehow. 

  
Dutch example: Geert wilders promising that we remove all deductibles (eigen risico) from healthcare, as poor people delay or just don't get healthcare due to that. in a debate with leftists parties he made it a very public point that it should be done NOW, not staggered over a few years. Now his party is in government and all of a sudden it can only be partially removed in 2027 instead of NOW. 

and nobody gives a fuck about the lie because they can spin that simple lie a lot easier than most complex real answers. the leftist's answer in my Dutch example was simple: We fully agree with the sentiment and also think we should remove deductibles HOWEVER we have to investigate the correct route to do this so we do not create issues in healthcare.

We dont force them to do blood donations. We dont force them to donate sperm or eggs. 

This means we also cant force a womans consent to offer her body to grow a baby. And she is allowed to take away her consent for any reason, jsut as i can ask a nurse to stop my blood donation at any point. Just as i can leave a hospital right before they prep me for surgery to donate a kidney. It may be unfair for another human, but its perfectly legal.

Dutch example: Geert wilders promising that we remove all deductibles (eigen risico) from healthcare, as poor people delay or just don't get healthcare due to that. in a debate with leftists parties he made it a very public point that it should be done NOW, not staggered over a few years.

I think both sides are stupid. Why does one side care if it's called a baby? And why does the other side care what the other does with their bodies so much that they want to remove choice?

Can't we just meet in the middle?","> Why does one side care if it's called a baby?

Because it's incredibly dishonest. That clump of cells is by no means what most people would refer to as, a baby. 

It's potentially a baby in the future, maybe if there's no miscarriage or any other fatal complications, but that clump of cells is most definitely not a baby in the sense that most people use the word baby.

Calling it a baby is purely an argument to emotion, it's meant to appeal to peoples sense of parental care and protection. You know babies, you love babies, they're cute and adorable and all that, and abortion is literally killing babies!!!! 

>And why does the other side care what the other does with their bodies so much that they want to remove choice?

Are you dumb? 

The other side thinks you're killing babies, they do not want you to kill babies, because they see that clump of cells as baby. They think killing babies is wrong, thus they do not want women to have access to killing babies.

Like, there's a very clear ideological difference there that you probably could have figured out if you spent literally a minute thinking about what you just wrote.

>Can't we just meet in the middle?

The fuck is the middle here? One side wants to retain a womans access to abortion, the other side wants to remove abortion in general as an option for any reason.

Pray tell, what is the middle here? Should we only deny choice *sometimes*? Decided by someone else who is not the woman who is pregnant and is forced to carry, birth and raise the child?",0,0

The argument many of these anti abortion people are making, is that life starts at conception. As in, the moment the egg is fertilized by sperm.

Now an IUD has two main ways it prevents pregnancy. The first one is that it changes cervical mucus so that it kills sperm when sperm gets there. This is very effective, but not 100% guaranteed success rate.

The other way IUD's prevent pregnancy is by changing the uterine wall so that if fertilization occurs, the egg cannot implant itself onto the uterine wall.

Repeating a raft of conservative media talking points proves nothing when you‚Äôre not interested in anything but trying to ‚Äòown the libz‚Äô. The lack of empathy and self-awareness that it takes to ignore the root causes of all of the issues she mentioned shows that it‚Äôs not about solving our problems as a nation but being able to use those problems as some sort of ‚Äògotcha!‚Äô against those she politically disagrees with. She fails to mention that instances of fires being set and police being murdered in 2020 George Floyd unrest were committed by Trump supporters (Minneapolis police station fire, Oakland police murders). She blows off mentions of Trump instigating January 6th & attempts to overthrow the election. She wants to think she‚Äôs so patriotic because her father served in the military, but yet many people engaged in the insurrection and trying to overthrow the election also served in the military and consider themselves ‚Äòpatriots‚Äô. That word has been bastardized by right-wing extremists in the Trump years just like they bastardized ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô during the astroturfing of the Tea Party during the Obama years. Those words lose all meaning under those circumstances. She wants to demonize the increasing homeless population as a byproduct of liberal policies but it‚Äôs really about the homeless being victims of Capitalism and Republican politicians having zero will to work on a solution for the issue because it might entail increasing taxes on millionaires & billionaires to do so.

This girl in the video did not espouse a single independent thought. She simply regurgitated a bunch of meaningless talking points to form a word salad that makes her feel informed.
