The lack of empathy and self-awareness that it takes to ignore the root causes of all of the issues she mentioned shows that it’s not about solving our problems as a nation but being able to use those problems as some sort of ‘gotcha!’ against those she politically disagrees with. She fails to mention that instances of fires being set and police being murdered in 2020 George Floyd unrest were committed by Trump supporters (Minneapolis police station fire, Oakland police murders). She blows off mentions of Trump instigating January 6th & attempts to overthrow the election. She wants to think she’s so patriotic because her father served in the military, but yet many people engaged in the insurrection and trying to overthrow the election also served in the military and consider themselves ‘patriots’. That word has been bastardized by right-wing extremists in the Trump years just like they bastardized ‘freedom’ during the astroturfing of the Tea Party during the Obama years. Those words lose all meaning under those circumstances. She wants to demonize the increasing homeless population as a byproduct of liberal policies but it’s really about the homeless being victims of Capitalism and Republican politicians having zero will to work on a solution for the issue because it might entail increasing taxes on millionaires & billionaires to do so.

This girl in the video did not espouse a single independent thought. She simply regurgitated a bunch of meaningless talking points to form a word salad that makes her feel informed.

It must be great being a patriotic American and not having to pay any tax for services... Oh wait they do pay tax. Sorry forgetful socialist unpatriotic me.

I realise that this might be my communist indoctrination talking but I thought the idea of patriotism in America was centred on protecting individual freedoms from the tyranny of a big bad centralised government. But I seem to have got this wrong as what it actually means is local government legislating to define the rights of individuals under the guise that they have the right to frame freedoms because they are closer to them than the federal govt. How community minded nothing says patriotic like your neighbour taking away your individual freedoms. I mean after all it's my nations favourite past time. Shit sorry we're not talking about nineteenth century Britain. My Marxist mind is struggling. 

I also can't quite see why immigration is a problem here. Ahhh it must be that the brown people are all socialist. What a terrible position to be in, surrounded by the red menace just waiting to spread their nefarious ideology in your land. 

That's right nothing says patriotic American like keeping out people fleeing persecution and poverty. Thank god those Native Americans had the good fortune to be able to push back those dastardly protestant nutters. Oh wait that's not how it went. 

You know that funny idea of the separation of church and state that some of those very unpatriotic crusty white men came up with when getting all pissy at the UK for imposing taxes. Pretty sure reading the bible in school was exactly the kind of patriotic act they wanted to avoid. But then again what would I know we have bishops sitting in our upper chamber.

So just to round up for little old Stalinist me.

1239,lopihgb,,957,,,"This should have been the initial response:

(3 seconds’ pause)

“I’ve detected straw man arguments just now, but let me focus on one. You said your dad served in our military for 30 years. Why do you think Democrats like Tim Walz haven’t served? Can you tell me what Trump has said about some of our military heros? Who desecrated Arlington?”",0,0
467,lomxpu0,,256,,,"That girl is the perfect encapsulation of the self-righteousness and narcissism that MAGA people engage in regularly. Repeating a raft of conservative media talking points proves nothing when you’re not interested in anything but trying to ‘own the libz’. The lack of empathy and self-awareness that it takes to ignore the root causes of all of the issues she mentioned shows that it’s not about solving our problems as a nation but being able to use those problems as some sort of ‘gotcha!’ against those she politically disagrees with. She fails to mention that instances of fires being set and police being murdered in 2020 George Floyd unrest were committed by Trump supporters (Minneapolis police station fire, Oakland police murders). She blows off mentions of Trump instigating January 6th & attempts to overthrow the election. She wants to think she’s so patriotic because her father served in the military, but yet many people engaged in the insurrection and trying to overthrow the election also served in the military and consider themselves ‘patriots’. That word has been bastardized by right-wing extremists in the Trump years just like they bastardized ‘freedom’ during the astroturfing of the Tea Party during the Obama years. Those words lose all meaning under those circumstances. She wants to demonize the increasing homeless population as a byproduct of liberal policies but it’s really about the homeless being victims of Capitalism and Republican politicians having zero will to work on a solution for the issue because it might entail increasing taxes on millionaires & billionaires to do so.

This girl in the video did not espouse a single independent thought. She simply regurgitated a bunch of meaningless talking points to form a word salad that makes her feel informed. However, the ideas, anecdotes and accusations are just warmed over tropes that conservatives have used for over a decade to mislead other conservatives like Fox ‘News’ viewers & it looks extremely silly to ACTUAL informed people like the young man she’s yelling at. If he could get a word in, he’d probably tell her as much.",2,0
